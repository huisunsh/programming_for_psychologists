A collection of IPython Notebooks for teaching Programming for Psychologists at UW-Madison.
---

This project is based on [introtopython.org](http://introtopython.org), an open resource for teaching and learning Python created by Eric Matthes (thank you Eric!). If you use PsychoPy for coding Experiments and/or have useful .. and/or have examples of skills that you want graduate students in Psychology/Cognitive Neuroscience programs to know, please contribute to the project by including additional IPython Notebooks.

You can view the raw notebooks using the IPython Notebook Viewer ([home page])(http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/lupyanlab/programming_for_psychologists/master/notebooks/index.ipynb). The content is similar on both sites, but the [class](http://sapir.psych.wisc.edu/programming_for_psychologists/) version is easier to navigate, and has some dynamic features such as collapsible Python output.
