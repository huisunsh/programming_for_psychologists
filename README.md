A collection of IPython Notebooks for teaching Programming to Psychology Grad Students at UW-Madison.
---

This project is based on [introtopython.org](http://introtopython.org), an open resource for teaching and learning Python created by Eric Matthes (thank you Eric!). If you think there are additional programming skills that are critical for Psych grad students to know, have examples of useful PsychoPy projects to develop experiment-design skills, and/or you have ideas for other relatedthat you want graduate students in Psychology/Cognitive Neuroscience programs to know, please contribute to the project by including additional IPython Notebooks.

You can view the raw notebooks using the IPython Notebook Viewer [(home page)](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/lupyanlab/programming_for_psychologists/master/notebooks/index.ipynb). The content is similar on both sites, but the [class](http://sapir.psych.wisc.edu/programming_for_psychologists/) version is easier to navigate and has some dynamic features such as collapsible Python output and a table of contents sidebar.
