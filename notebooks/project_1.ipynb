    "## Option 1 - Visual Recognition Memory and Verbal Lures\n",
    "The first option is to implement a visual recognition memory experiment. As with most of such studies, the experiment will have two parts: study and test. In the study part, participants see a sequence of images. To maintain attention, they perform a 1-back task, pressing the spacebar anytime they detect an image repeating back-to-back. During the *test* session which will immediately follow the study, participants see each image and perform an old/new recognition task.\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment will test the hypothesis that although both study and test materials are *images*, participants will show significantly higher false-alarms on rhyme (e.g., rake/cake, bear/pear)  and homonym trials, e.g., (bat [the animal], bat [baseball bat], flour/flower).\n",
    "\n",
    "The precise stimuli will be available shortly. In the meantime, here is a schematic so you can start thinking about how you should design the trial list."
